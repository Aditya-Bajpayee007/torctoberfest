## Responsibilities

As a maintainer, you are responsible for:

- Triaging and labeling issues
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Providing constructive feedback to contributors
- Maintaining code quality standards
- Fostering a welcoming community
- Managing Hacktoberfest participation
- Keeping documentation up to date

## Issue Management

### Creating Issues

When creating new issues:

1. **Use appropriate templates**
   - Choose the right difficulty level template
   - Fill out all sections completely

2. **Write clear descriptions**
   - Explain what needs to be done
   - Provide context and examples
   - List acceptance criteria
   - Estimate time required

3. **Add proper labels**
   - Difficulty level: `good first issue`, `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`
   - Type: `bug`, `feature`, `documentation`, `enhancement`
   - Event: `hacktoberfest` (if eligible)
   - Status: `help wanted`, `blocked`, etc.

### Labeling Strategy

**Difficulty Labels:**
- `good first issue` - Process-focused tasks for first-time contributors
- `beginner` - Small coding tasks requiring basic skills
- `intermediate` - Feature implementation requiring planning
- `advanced` - Complex architectural work

**Type Labels:**
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `feature` - New functionality
- `enhancement` - Improve existing functionality
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `testing` - Test coverage improvements
- `infrastructure` - CI/CD, tooling, etc.

**Status Labels:**
- `help wanted` - Actively seeking contributors
- `blocked` - Waiting on dependencies
- `in progress` - Someone is working on it
- `needs review` - Ready for maintainer review

**Special Labels:**
- `hacktoberfest` - Counts toward Hacktoberfest
- `invalid` - Not a valid contribution
- `spam` - Spam PR
- `duplicate` - Duplicate issue/PR

### Triaging Issues

**Daily tasks:**

1. Review new issues
2. Add appropriate labels
3. Respond to questions
4. Close duplicates or invalid issues
5. Update issue status as needed

**Weekly tasks:**

1. Review stale issues (no activity for 7+ days)
2. Check if claimed issues have progress
3. Reassign abandoned issues
4. Update documentation based on common questions

## Pull Request Review

### Review Timeline

Aim to provide initial feedback within:

- Good first issues: 24 hours
- Beginner issues: 24-48 hours
- Intermediate issues: 48-72 hours
- Advanced issues: 3-5 days

### Review Checklist

For every PR, check:

**Code Quality**
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] No unnecessary code or comments
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Input validation where needed
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities

**Documentation**
- [ ] JSDoc comments on all functions
- [ ] Usage examples included
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] Clear commit messages

**Testing**
- [ ] Tests included for new functionality
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] No broken functionality

**Process**
- [ ] PR template filled out
- [ ] Issue reference included
- [ ] One issue per PR (focused changes)
- [ ] Clean commit history

### Providing Feedback

**Be constructive:**
```markdown
Great work on this utility! A few suggestions:

1. Could you add JSDoc comments to the helper function?
2. Let's add a test case for empty string input
3. Consider renaming `temp` to `temperature` for clarity

Once these are addressed, this will be ready to merge!
```

**Be specific:**
```markdown
On line 23, we should validate the input before processing:

```javascript
if (typeof input !== 'string') {
  throw new TypeError('Input must be a string');
}
```

This prevents runtime errors with invalid input.
```

**Be encouraging:**
```markdown
This is a solid first contribution! Welcome to open source!

The logic looks good. Just a couple small things to clean up and we're good to go.
```

### Approving PRs

Before merging:

1. All CI checks pass
2. Code review approved
3. No merge conflicts
4. Acceptance criteria met
5. Documentation updated

After merging:

1. Thank the contributor
2. Close related issue
3. Add contributor to AUTHORS.md (if first contribution)
4. Update project board/milestones

### Handling Spam

**Identifying spam:**
